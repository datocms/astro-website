# Multi-stage builds allow us to create intermediate images for building
# while keeping the final production image clean and minimal.

# ==== Base stage ====
# Sets up the foundation that other stages will build upon

# Copying these separately from the rest of the code allows better caching
# If dependencies haven't changed, Docker can reuse cached layers

# ==== Production dependencies stage ====
# This stage installs only the dependencies needed for production

# ==== Build dependencies stage ====

# This stage includes ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies)

# * Node.js runtime (from base image)
# * Production dependencies (from prod-deps stage)
# * Built application files (from build stage)

# * Source code
# * Development dependencies
# * Build tools
