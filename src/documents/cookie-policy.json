Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as \"Trackers\" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br />\n  For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.\n</p>\n\n<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n\n\n\n  <p>This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br />\nThe validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.<br />\nIn addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.</p>\n\n\n  \n\n\n<h2>How this Application uses Trackers</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"iub-purpose-stack iub-purpose-stack-1\" >\n    Necessary\n  </h3>\n\n  <p>This Application uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.</p>\n\n\n\n    <h4>Trackers managed by third parties</h4>\n\n    <ul class=\"for_boxes\">\n      \n    <li>\n  <details open class=\"box_primary box_10 expand\">\n    <summary>\n      <h3 class=\"w_icon_24 policyicon_purpose_3374942 iub-purpose iub-purpose-3374942\">\n        Cloudflare (Cloudflare)\n      </h3>\n    </summary>\n\n    <div class=\"details_body\">\n      <div class=\"wrap\">\n        <p>Cloudflare is a traffic optimization and distribution service provided by Cloudflare Inc.<br/>\nThe way Cloudflare is integrated means that it filters all the traffic through this Application, i.e., communication between this Application and the User's browser, while also allowing analytical data from this Application to be collected.</p>\n      </div>\n\n        <p>Personal Data processed: Cookies and various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service.</p>\n\n      \n      <p>Place of processing:  United States &ndash;
