# DatoCMS Website

This repository contains the source code of [datocms.com](https://www.datocms.com). It's built with Astro, gql.tada and the DatoCMS Astro SDK.

It's a server-only app (every route is dynamic), and it's meant to be the origin for a surrogate-keys-capable CDN like Fastly, which will then apply granular caching rules thanks to [DatoCMS cache tags](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/cache-tags).

It can also be directly visited by the content editors to see the result of their draft changes in real time.

# How to run locally?

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/datocms/website`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run decrypt-env` to decrypt the secrets.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start a local development server at [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

# Conventions

## SVGs

SVGs are inlined, both in HTML and CSS. For the HTML part, there's a `<Svg />` Astro component:

```jsx
<Svg name="icons/regular/tachometer" />
```

There are two main directories for SVGs: `src/icons/` and `src/svg`. Depending on the directory, `<Svg />` will apply different SVGO settings:

- SVGs in `src/icons/` are 1em in size and have their `fill` color inherited from the parent HTML element's color attribute by forcing the fill of every element to `currentColor`.
- SVGs in `src/svg/` are more flexible: they don‚Äôt have a set size, and there‚Äôs no automatic fill color.

For the CSS part, we use [`postcss-inline-svg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-inline-svg) which let's you inline SVGs like this:

```css
background: svg-load('icons/regular/check.svg');
background: svg-load('img/arrow-down.svg', fill=#000, stroke=#fff);
```

## `<Prose />`

This component is meant to add some nice, consistent formatting on text-heavy content like articles or blog posts.

The `<prose-island>` element is a custom HTML element that you can wrap around
part of HTML inside <Prose /> that you don't want to style with the rules below.
It's basically a reset.

```jsx
<Prose>
  <h1>This will be formatted</h1>

  <prose-island>
    <h1>This will NOT be formatted</h1>

    <Prose>
      <h1>This will be formatted again</h1>
    </Prose>
  </prose-island>
</Prose>
```

## Remote markdown content

To render markdown, you can use:

- `<Markdown of={content} />` or `markdown(content)` (they're basically the same).
- `inlineMarkdown` for small, single-paragraph markdown content that you want to render without the wrapping paragraph.

## Structured Text

Avoid directly using `<StructuredText />`. Prefer `<Text />` or `<InlineText />` which offers a few sane defaults.

Also, make sure to use `withAllComponents`, inside `blockComponents`, `linkToRecordComponents` and `inlineRecordComponents` to type-check that EVERY kind of available block is handled correctly!

```jsx
<Text
  data={episode.content}
  blockComponents={withAllComponents(episode.content.blocks, {
    InternalVideoRecord: InternalVideo,
    ImageRecord: Image,
    TableRecord: Table,
  })}
/>
```

# Weird issues...

## Astro, Prettier and white-spaces

Prettier sometimes will format the code this way (please notice the {link.text} is on a separate line). This will generate visible white-space inside the link.

```jsx
<div>
  {navLinks.map((link) => (
    <a href={link.href}>{link.text}</a>
  ))}
</div>
```

It's a [known issue](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro/issues/308). Sometimes you can solve adding `/* prettier-ignore */` to avoid auto-formatting...

## Astro.slots.has() returns true when slot exists inside a falsy conditional block

The title says it all. More info in this [Github issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/10024).
